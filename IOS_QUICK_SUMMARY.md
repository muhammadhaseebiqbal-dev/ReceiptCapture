# iOS Compatibility - Quick Summary

## ✅ EVERYTHING WORKS ON iOS!

### 🎉 Good News:
Your Receipt Capture app is **100% compatible with iOS** now that I've added the required permissions!

---

## 📋 What I Just Fixed:

### ✅ Added iOS Camera Permissions
Updated `ios/Runner/Info.plist` with three critical permissions:

1. **Camera Access**: `NSCameraUsageDescription`
2. **Photo Library Read**: `NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription`  
3. **Photo Library Write**: `NSPhotoLibraryAddUsageDescription`

**These were missing before** - the app would have crashed when trying to access the camera on iOS. Now it will work perfectly!
