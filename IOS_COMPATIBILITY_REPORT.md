## ‚úÖ Features That Work Perfectly on iOS

### 1. **Haptic Feedback** ‚úÖ 100% Compatible

All haptic feedback implementations are fully compatible with iOS and will work even better than on Android due to Apple's Taptic Engine.

| Feature | Haptic Type | iOS Support | Quality |
|---------|-------------|-------------|---------|
| Settings Tiles | `selectionClick()` | ‚úÖ Full | Excellent |
| Navigation Tabs | `selectionClick()` | ‚úÖ Full | Excellent |

**Code Implementation:**
```dart
// These are iOS-native APIs wrapped by Flutter
HapticFeedback.selectionClick()  // Triggers UISelectionFeedbackGenerator
HapticFeedback.mediumImpact()    // Triggers UIImpactFeedbackGenerator
```

**iOS Haptic System Used:**
- `selectionClick()` ‚Üí Uses `UISelectionFeedbackGenerator`

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Required iOS Configurations

### üî¥ CRITICAL: Missing Camera Permissions

**Current Status:** ‚ùå Not Configured
**Impact:** App will crash when accessing camera on iOS
**Priority:** HIGH

#### Required Changes:

Add these to `ios/Runner/Info.plist`:

```xml
<!-- Camera Permission -->
<key>NSCameraUsageDescription</key>
<string>Receipt Capture needs access to your camera to take photos of receipts</string>

<!-- Photo Library Permission (for gallery) -->
<key>NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription</key>
<string>Receipt Capture needs access to your photo library to import receipt images</string>

<!-- Photo Library Add Permission (for saving) -->
<key>NSPhotoLibraryAddUsageDescription</key>
<string>Receipt Capture needs permission to save receipt images to your photo library</string>
```

**Without these permissions:**
- ‚ùå App will crash when camera is opened
- ‚ùå Gallery picker won't work
- ‚ùå No image import capability
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Apple will reject the app during App Store review

### üìù Updated Info.plist

Here's the complete Info.plist with required permissions:
